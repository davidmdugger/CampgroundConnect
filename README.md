# CampgroundConnect
A fully functional node.js web app with a mongoDB backend, RESTful routes, user authentication, authorization, and a frontend of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery.

You can sign up and your login is stored in the database while your password is encrypted then stored with its hash.

You can create a new campground, edit the campground you create, or delete it from the database.

Authorization is also a feature to this app. You can only edit or delete campgrounds or comments you create.

You can see the live working version hosted on heroku here: https://aqueous-lowlands-33100.herokuapp.com/
